# React Github Issues Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple project made for a technical test using only ES6+, React and [React Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

The objective of this test is use the Semantic UI components to create and improve the UX of Table component that shows some issues data from [Github React Repository](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues) and implement one UI feature of my choice that would be usefull for an end-user.

To improve the UX from this project I had used the [Placeholder](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/placeholder/) component to show that data is being loaded(Check the screenshots below), The [Popup](https://react.semantic-ui.com/modules/popup/) component to show a brief of the Issue body data when mouse is over the title cell, [List](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/list/) component to show the issues labels as a list and the [Label](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/label/) component with modified background color to show the labels with the colors that come from the API data.

The UI component that I found useful as an end-user was the Light/Dark Theme. I implemented a ToggleButton component that change the colors of the SemanticUI components.

The project also have some tests for the created component.
